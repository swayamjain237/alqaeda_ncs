Hello everyone!
This is our prototype for Smart Campus Security using IoT.
You can access the webpage by clicking on index.html and then click on ADMINISTRATOR LOGIN to open the homepage.
From there you can browse the webpage for features that we would implement in our security systems.
The campus security would be directly connected to a server through which our website would access its data and provide real time solutions as per the problem.

We will be using RFID tags in ID cards for easy identification and tracking of students.
All students as well as faculty details can be managed through the online portal.
A sensor present at all entry gates would catch the signal and upload the data into the server and the admins can access it from our webpage.
Every hall/ room will have cameras that would be able to detect faces of people present there.
We will also implement Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) through cameras nearby parking areas in campus which would provide all the details of the vehicles present in the campus.
Emergency Services and Announcements can also be given through the website itself.
Entry and Exit logs can be monitored through the website.
The campus can be locked during any emergency outbreaks.

With these implementations, We @Alqaeda are here to provide you safe and secure life around your campus.
